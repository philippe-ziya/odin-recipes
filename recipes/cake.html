    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days. </p> 
    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Mince beef</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta for 10mins</li>
        <li>Add the mince beef prefarbly cooked</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce and mix together</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven until cooked</li>
    </ol>
